ANA are not detected in all patients with CTD; negative results are obtained with serum from 5% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis, 25% with Sjogren's syndrome and 50% with rheumatoid arthritis. If the patient appears to have SLE, for example, but the initial test for ANA is negative, the test should be repeated and the test for anti-Ro antibody should be ordered. Anti-Ro antibody is found in about 65% of patients with ANA-negative SLE. Mandakolathur R.

       "519238  NEGATIVE AT 1:40 AND 1:160 *** Normal Value: Negative at 1:40 and 1:160 ***          To interpret a negative test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in a patient suspected of having a rheumatic disease, the following limitations should be noted. ANA are not detected in all patients with CTD; negative results are obtained with serum from 5% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis, 25% with Sjogren's syndrome and 50% with rheumatoid arthritis. If the patient appears to have SLE, for example, but the initial test for ANA is negative, the test should be repeated and the test for anti-Ro antibody should be ordered. Anti-Ro antibody is found in about 65% of patients with ANA-negative SLE. Mandakolathur R.

       "      <td>(NOTE) Mixed Homogeneous and Speckled pattern. INTERPRETIVE INFORMATION: ANA by IFA, IgG Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are seen in a variety of systemic rheumatic diseases and are determined by indirect fluorescence assay (IFA) using HEp-2 substrate with an IgG-specific conjugate. ANA titers less than or equal to 1:80 have variable relevance while titers greater than or equal to 1:160 are considered clinically significant. These antibodies may precede clinical disease onset; however, healthy individuals and those with advanced age have been reported to be positive for ANA. When observed, one of the five basic patterns is reported: homogeneous, peripheral/rim, speckled, centromere, or nucleolar. If cytoplasmic fluorescence is observed, it is noted. IFA methodology is subjective and has occasionally been shown to lack sensitivity for anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. Negative results do not necessarily rule out the presence of SSc. If clinical suspicion remains, consider further testing for U3-RNP, PM/Scl, or Th/To antibodies associated with SSc.

       "356238  (NOTE) Mixed Homogeneous and Speckled pattern. INTERPRETIVE INFORMATION: ANA by IFA, IgG Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are seen in a variety of systemic rheumatic diseases and are determined by indirect fluorescence assay (IFA) using HEp-2 substrate with an IgG-specific conjugate. ANA titers less than or equal to 1:80 have variable relevance while titers greater than or equal to 1:160 are considered clinically significant. These antibodies may precede clinical disease onset; however, healthy individuals and those with advanced age have been reported to be positive for ANA. When observed, one of the five basic patterns is reported: homogeneous, peripheral/rim, speckled, centromere, or nucleolar. If cytoplasmic fluorescence is observed, it is noted. IFA methodology is subjective and has occasionally been shown to lack sensitivity for anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. Negative results do not necessarily rule out the presence of SSc. If clinical suspicion remains, consider further testing for U3-RNP, PM/Scl, or Th/To antibodies associated with SSc.

Antibody to hepatitis C virus has been found in about 50% of patients with low LKM antibody titers. LKM antibody-positive CAH, which represents less than 10% of HBsAg-negative CAH, is the most common autoimmune liver disease of childhood and has a relatively unfavorable prog- nosis.; 3ML RTT   \n",

Please refer any questions to the Molecular Diagnostics Lab at extension 4-7644. This is a quantitative assay which amplifies HCV RNA by RT-PCR. Results of this test may be clinically useful in monitoring a patient's clinical course or response to antiviral therapy but should not be used to make the diagnosis of HCV infection.  A test result of less than the lower quantitation limit (<600 IU/ml) should not be interpreted as no HCV RNA detected, rather it suggests that the level of HCV detected was below the linear range of the assay and could not be accurately quantitated. This assay has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration but has been validated by the MGH Microbiology Laboratory.  FDA approval is not required since this laboratory is licensed under CLIA for high complexity testing.\n",
